    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Rodrigo Ruiz. I am a 23 year old student living in Mount Airy, GA. 
      I spend my free time playing video games with friends, listening to music, watching sports, and if I'm feeling motivated, working out at the gym.

      As a kid, I struggled to decide what I wanted to do in life. My earliest choices were becoming an archeologist, a firefighter, or a mechanic.
      After experiencing a tiny bit of HTML in high school, I ultimately landed on becoming a programmer. I feel I can be a creative person but
      have trouble showing it, but I believe programming is a method I can really express my ideas.
    </p>

      I was previously a student at the University of North Georgia pursueing a Computer Science degree, 
      but after taking a couple semesters off I decided to join Digitalcrafts in hopes to improve my skills quicker.
      Im very excited to meet everyone and learn to program proficiently. I hope we can all make a career out of something we are passionate about.
    </p>
